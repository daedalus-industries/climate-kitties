= VCUs - also known as Climate Kitties

This is a simple NFT project for Voluntary Carbon Units, informally referred to within as the technology used is the same as the popular https://www.cryptokitties.co[CryptoKitties] trading games.

Once minted, either locally or on the Kovan testnet through the https://dsscm-metadata.appspot.com/[hosted dashboard], VCUs (or Climate Kitties ðŸ™‚) have the same behaviour as most ERC721 tokens. They work in https://www.coinbase.com[the] https://enjinx.io[same] https://trustwallet.com[wallets], and can be sold on collectables exchanges like https://opensea.io[OpenSea] or https://boxswap.io[BoxSwap].

VCUs differ from most tokens as they can be retired. Retired VCUs can no longer be transferred, and have a retirement date. VCUs can also be negotiable [they can be assigned to another legal person] or non-negotiable. Non-negotiable VCUs can be transferred once after minting, and are then automatically retired and cannot be transferred again.

Since this automatic retirement is a feature of the _token_ *not* the _exchange or wallet_, this does not prevent the VCU from being sold through a 3rd party service. Other requirements, such as KYC or AML measures, could be similiarly introduced without breaking compatibility with the wider Ethereum ecosystem.

The kitties are currently immortal, that's to say, having issued one we cannot recall or destroy it (or control how it is transferred). But this can be changed, and arbitrary governance mechanisms introduced. See Circle's https://blog.circle.com/2018/11/07/a-deeper-look-at-stablecoins-and-usdc/[USDC] for example. (Which with some fiddling, Climate Kitties can https://medium.com/opensea/buy-and-sell-crypto-collectibles-with-usdc-1ec58aef1022[already use] through OpenSea.)

Currently we use a small webservice on Google Cloud for image hosting. Its failure would not affect anything other than image on each kittie. In the future, we should be able to remove this but we need to understand the metadata requirements better.


== Prerequisites

The code dependencies are fully described in `package.json`. Only `npm install` is needed.

For deployment only GCloud has been configured [the `app.yaml` files], and this will require the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Cloud CLI] for deployment from your machine.

The use of the https://github.com/creationix/nvm[Node Version Manager] is recommened.

== Contracts and components

=== Web

There are two website components: the minting dashboard (found at `app/` ) and the metadata server (which is simply `app.js`).

Both are deployable by following the GCloud App Engine https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/quickstart[guide] for nodejs.

=== Dashboard

The minting dashboard has its own `package.json`, and its own copies of the contracts JSON `src/contracts`. The dashboard contracts JSON is copied automatically when using the root tasks `npm run migrate:local` or `npm run migrate:local`. It is based on the https://truffleframework.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-drizzle-and-react[standard React+Drizzle template].

=== Metadata Server

The metadata server shares its dependencies and contracts JSON with the root Truffle project.

=== Contracts

Currently, only the Voluntary Carbon Unit NFT token is implemented. It is contained in the source file `VoluntaryCarbonUnit.sol`.

Due to the extra metadata required, the standard `mint(to, id)` function is *not* supported. Use `mintVcu(...)` instead.

Minting a new VCU requires the sending address to have minter permissions granted by calling `token.addMinter(address)` from the owning address.

Note that the standard migration tasks in NPM, that is `migrate:local` and `migrate:rinkeby` reset the network as we do not have an upgrade strategy for this prototype. As we Git ignore all the contract JSON, we don't have even the most basic packaging solution either.

== Quick start

=== Running locally

. Install root dependencies `npm install`
. Start a local chain `npx ganache-cli`
. Migrate to the local chain `npm run migrate:local`
. Start the metadata server `npm run start`
. Switch into the dashboard directory `cd app`
. Install dashboard dependencies `npm install`
. Start the dashboard `npm run start`

Note that there will be domain mismatch between the metadata server, and that given by `tokenURI(...)` called on the local chain instance of the Voluntary Carbon Unit NFT.

Also only my MetaMask wallet address is added as a minter in `migrations/4_nifty_minter.js`. Fire up `npx truffle console --network local` to add your own.


=== Unit Testing

`npm run test`

Only the root Truffle project is currently unit tested.

Something something Apache Griffin to write stuff :)
